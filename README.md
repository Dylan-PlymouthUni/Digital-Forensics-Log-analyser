# Digital-Forensics-Log-analyser
This Digital Forensics Log Analyser will ingest log files (from the web, systems logs, servers and network devices) I will Parse them into structured data, and look for potential anomalies. it will focus on suspicious phrases (e.g., "failed login,"  "authentication failure," "unauthorised access") using python and pandas.

Key Features
Log Parsing: Read log files and convert them into a structured format.

Pattern Matching: Use regular expressions to detect suspicious keywords or patterns.

Reporting: Output detected anomalies in a clear, tabulated format.

Extendability: Building a project that can later be extended with date-time filtering, IP address analysis, and even visualization (e.g., using Matplotlib).
